## Installation

### Required libraries

To get the notebooks in this tutorial running, we recommend using a Python installation via [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).

We also recommend setting up a separate virtual environment. This bundles all the packages you need.

``
conda create -n ml-tutorial
conda activate ml-tutorial
``

Then, install the packages that will become your toolbox for this tutorial.

``
conda install numpy matplotlib skikit-learn jupyter
``

### This library

``
git clone ####
cd ####
``

To start the Jupyter notebook server, execute

``
jupyter notebook
``

A browser window will automatically open where you can view and edit the notebooks.
